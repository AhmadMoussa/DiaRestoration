2. Estimation of data an image was taken
3. Estimation of the age of persons in the image

## Introduction and Background

Slide photos were a popular cost effective way to record images in the 50 and 60s. But this type of photo has quickly fallen out of popularity with the rise of the digital image and the smart-phone. This relatively quick transition and shift in technology left many families with stacks of old slide photos and no good way of digitalizing them.
This paper attempts the restoration and digitalization of these images as well as the improvement of the quality of these images, without having to invest in a dedicated hardware device for this purpose.
Additionally we find it important to estimate the date of taking the photo as it gives important information to the owner.
